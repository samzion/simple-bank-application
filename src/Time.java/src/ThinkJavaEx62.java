     * 2 Letâ€™s say you are given a number, a, and you want to find
     * its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the
     * answer, x0, and then improve the guess by using this formula:
     * x1 = (x0 + a/x0)/2
     * For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with x0 = 6,
     * then x1 = (6 + 9/6)/2 = 3.75, which is closer. We can repeat the procedure,
     * using x1 to calculate x2, and so on. In this case, x2 = 3.075 and x3 = 3.00091.
     * So the repetition converges quickly on the correct answer.
     * Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You
     * should not use Math.sqrt.
     * As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until
     * it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use
     * Math.abs to calculate the absolute value of the difference.
